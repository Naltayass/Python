# Python
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. All patients included in the dataset are females at least 21 years old from Pima
Indian heritage. The original dataset has 768 observations with a total of 9 variables, which
are pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree,
age, and outcome. We conducted Principal Component Analysis to analyze the Diabetes Database, 
considering covariance and correlation matrices in Python.
Five classification models will be built based on the PCA 98% dataset and the original dataset.
